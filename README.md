# Artificial-Angel-Bot (WIP)

Discord bot for Memento Mori. My aim is to make a bot that can easily display the game data from discord.

The bot is not yet ready to be fully deployed in servers and I still need to figure out how I should host it.

To be used with https://github.com/ScobraCK/MementoMori-data

Currently is dependent on being in the same folder as the data and need to change.
